# types of services:
  # ClusterIP (the default type)
    # the pods that match this service's selector
    # will be exposed at some IP address visible WITHIN the cluster.
    # this makes sense for pods that only need to be accessed from within the cluster,
    # not from outside.
    # get to those pods' [target-port] at: http://[cluster-ip]:[port]
    # also, usually, there is DNS within the cluster, for http://[service-name]:[port]
  # NodePort
    # same as ClusterIP, AND, a port on all nodes will be open and routed to the pods.
    # suitable for pods that need to be accessed from outside the cluster.
    # get to those pods' [target-port] at: http://[any-node-ip]:[node-port]
  # LoadBalancer
    # same as NodePort, AND, relies on some non-builtin implemention of load balancing,
    # especially one provided by the cloud vendor like Azure, AWS, GCP.
    # we can use this on cloud-managed k8s clusters, like AKS.
