    # writing code, we find that some pieces of data
    # are always used together
    student_ids = [1, 2, 3]

    # rather than accidentally associating that data, let's use data structures
    # intelligently to keep it organized together
    student_info = [(1, 'bob'), (2, 'tim'), (3, 'fred')]
    # combine data and associated behavior into one unit called an object
    # encapsulation  - combining these things into one unit
    #    that controls access/its own rules about that stuff

    # classes are templates for making new objects
    # in other languages, you can't tack on new instance variables (aka fields)
        # besides the ones defined by the class. you can in python

# a namespace is a context where variables live
# the way that python interprets any name of a variable/etc
#  like fred, Person, print, str, etc
# LEGB namespaces
# first, it checks the local namespace
# then, any enclosing namespaces,
# then, the global namespace,
# then, the built-in namespace (print, str)
