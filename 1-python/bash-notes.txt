bash is a shell program that lets us run many programs
    using a text-based interface.

some commands:
    cd <dir>
        change directory, can be absolute (like "/c/revature")
        or relative (like "my-project" in the current folder)
        ".." means, the parent of the current folder.
    ls <dir>
        list contents of a directory
        (or the current directory, by default)
    mkdir <dir>
        create a directory
    rm <path>
        delete a file
    rm -r <path>
        delete a directory with its contents
    mv <path1> <path2>
        rename/move a file/directory
    touch <path>
        create an empty file
    pwd
        print working directory (folder you're in right now)

some other things to know:
    .. means parent directory
        (we can chain it, e.g. cd ../../notes)
    . means current directory (e.g. explorer .)
    absolute paths
        start with /
        means the same no matter your current folder.
        e.g. /c/revature/trainer-code
    relative paths
        do not start with /
        are relative to the current folder.
    variables, $
    PATH

exercises (with just the command line):
    1. create an empty file
        touch myfile.txt
    2. rename that file
        mv myfile.txt newfile.txt
    3. create a new folder
        mkdir myfolder
    4. move the file into the folder
        mv newfile.txt myfolder
    5. delete the folder including its contents
        rm -r myfolder
    6. look up "echo" and use it to output some text.
        echo "My name is Nick"
    7. look up "which" and use it to find where git is installed.
        which git
    8. look up "grep" and use it to search a file for some text.
        grep grep notes/bash-notes.txt
    9. look up "find" and use it to search for all .txt files in some folder.
        find . -name "*.txt"
    10. look up "cat" and use it to show file contents.
        cat .gitignore
    11. use echo to make a new file with some contents.
        echo "text" > filename.txt

|, >, >>
* stands for 0 or more of any character.
bash keeps history of all your typed commands
    up-arrow accesses history.
tab completion


in a linux-type program (especially one used from the command line)
there are three "streams" that the program uses.

stdin (standard input) (0)
    SOME commands look here for some type of input.
    by default, this is keyboard input into the terminal.
stdout (standard output) (1)
    by default, this is printed to the display.
stderr (standard error) (2)
    by default, this is printed to the display.
    (this is for error messages/diagnostics, not "regular output")

"redirection"

> [file]
redirect stdout to a file (overwriting it)

>> [file]
redirect stdout to a file (appending to it)

[cmd1] | [cmd2]
redirect stdout of cmd1 to stdin of cmd2
