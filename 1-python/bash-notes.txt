bash is a shell program that lets us run many programs
    using a text-based interface.

some commands:
    cd <dir>
        change directory, can be absolute (like "/c/revature")
        or relative (like "my-project" in the current folder)
        ".." means, the parent of the current folder.
    ls <dir>
        list contents of a directory
        (or the current directory, by default)
    mkdir <dir>
        create a directory
    rm <path>
        delete a file
    rm -r <path>
        delete a directory with its contents
    mv <path1> <path2>
        rename/move a file/directory
    touch <path>
        create an empty file
    pwd
        print working directory (folder you're in right now)

some other things to know:
    .. means parent directory
        (we can chain it, e.g. cd ../../notes)
    . means current directory (e.g. explorer .)
    absolute paths
        start with /
        means the same no matter your current folder.
        e.g. /c/revature/trainer-code
    relative paths
        do not start with /
        are relative to the current folder.
    variables, $
    PATH

exercises (with just the command line):
    1. create an empty file
    2. rename that file
    3. create a new folder
    4. move the file into the folder
    5. delete the folder including its contents
    6. look up "echo" and use it to output some text.
    7. look up "which" and use it to find where git is installed.
    8. look up "grep" and use it to search a file for some text.
    9. look up "find" and use it to search for all .txt files in some folder.
    10. look up "cat" and use it to show file contents.
    11. use echo to make a new file with some contents.

|, >, >>
* stands for 0 or more of any character.
